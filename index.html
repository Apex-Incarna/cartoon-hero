            <p>Hondo Ohnaka is arguably the most imfamous pirate in the Star Wars galaxy. First appearing in the Clone Wars as a pirate captain who managed to capture Count Dooku, Hondo also captured fans' hearts with his wit, humor, and pirate flair. Although he appeared as an adversary as often he did a friend, Hondo throughout the Clone Wars maintained an air of good, citing his actions as entirely impersonal and simply business-oriented. He even referred to Jedis Obi-Wan Kendobi and Anakin Skywalker as his "friends," a moniker that he maintained throughout the Galactic Civil War and later regaled to his new Jedi friend Ezra Bridger. Bridger's belief in the rebel cause facinated Hondo, to the point that he pledged his allegiance to Ezra and his fight to liberate Ezra's homeworld of Lothal from Imperial occupation. Playing a role in several confrontations with the Empire, Hondo's defining contribution was participating in the assult on Lothal's Imperial Complex. Ezra, Hondo, and the rest of the rebels used the Empire's own military protocol against them, managing to recall and contain all Imperial forces on Lothal into the Complex before launching it into the air and detonating it, ending the Empire's reign of terror on Lothal for good. Later in life, Hondo ran a business called Hondo's Transport Solutions. A front for smuggling, Hondo used the business to assist the Resistance agaisnt the looming threat of the First Order as much as he did for his own profit, making Hondo one of the few Star Wars characters to participate in the main conflicts of all three eras of Star Wars.</p>
